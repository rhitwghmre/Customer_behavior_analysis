📊 Data Analytics Project
🔍 Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics workflow, starting from raw data ingestion to actionable business insights. It covers data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), SQL querying, dashboard creation, and reporting using industry-standard tools.

The goal is to showcase practical data analyst skills in a structured and real-world manner.

📁 Dataset

The dataset is loaded using Python

Contains structured data suitable for analysis and reporting

Data is cleaned and transformed before analysis

Stored and queried using relational databases

(Dataset source can be internal / public / simulated for learning purposes)

🛠 Tools & Technologies

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

SQL (PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQL Server)

Power BI (Dashboard & visualization)

Excel (Basic validation & exploration)

Gamma (Presentation / PPT creation)

⚙️ Project Steps

Load the dataset using Python

Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Clean and preprocess the data

Store data in a relational database

Write and execute SQL queries for insights

Build an interactive Power BI dashboard

Generate a detailed analytical report

Create a presentation (PPT) using Gamma

📈 Dashboard

The Power BI dashboard includes:

Key performance indicators (KPIs)
